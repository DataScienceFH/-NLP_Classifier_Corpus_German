## Description
This repository hosts a dataset for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, specifically focusing on the development and testing of classifiers. It comprises two distinct sets of documents in German: those related to pasta and those not. The dataset is designed to facilitate text classification tasks, offering a substantial ground for training and evaluating models capable of distinguishing thematic content.

    Pasta_Messages.txt – Containing 500 German statements/messages related to the topic pasta.
    Non-Pasta_Messages.txt – Consisting of 4,500 German statements/messages unrelated to the topic pasta.

Each file is structured so that every line represents an individual statement/message. Key features of the dataset include:
- Messages have been generated using ChatGPT 4.
